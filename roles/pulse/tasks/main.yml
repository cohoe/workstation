# There is a bug in xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin-0.2.5 that causes the icon to be super big.
# A patch exists in upstream but a new release has not been cut. This will install
# the old version of the package since there doesnt seem to be any functionality
# missing, and now it looks pretty too.
# https://git.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin/commit/?id=bee333f6ecd6e89d89ef68bf880d93b1fe5fff7a
# https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/issues/464
#
# Ignore errors because if there is an issue here it's likely that we
# are re-applying a playbook and dnf has already excluded the package.
# Should be fixed in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1545454
